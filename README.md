Th Tell Iztabba mudbrick analyse are part of the #BuildingSustainability project thatt aims to investigate Levantine Iron Age earthen architecture as a reflection of social dynamics, using the approach of analysing mudbricks as material culture. Furthermore the study aims to examine changes in architectural form and technology alongside the reconstruction of technological and social processes of earthen materials manufacture and construction. This multidisciplinary study relies on three disciplines: building archaeology, geoarchaeology and anthropology of architecture.
